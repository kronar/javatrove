This if fork of Java Trove project of Andres Almiray which I used to show fault injection testing  with groovy. 

Build steps:
1. Chekout this repo 
2. cd github-06/
3. ./gradlew build - for now 2 tests are failing but it is not showstopper. 
4. run java app e.g. java -jar build/libs/github-api-06-all.jar
5. try to query jboss organization from GitHub
6. run  enableFIT.sh - file __githubFIT.impl will be renamed.
7. try to query jboss organization from GitHub once again
